Decarcerate Utah is a prison abolitionist group whose primary goal is to shift
the discourse on incarceration. We recognize the violence conducted by the U.S.
government against Indigenous people, including unjust imprisonments, and we
respectfully acknowledge the Utes, Goshutes, Paiutes, Shoshone, and Navajo, on
whose ancestral lands we conduct our campaigns.

We share resources, host workshops, and organize campaigns about the abolition
of policing, prisons and jails, immigration enforcement, and surveillanceâ€”all
with the belief that this is how we create safer, healthier, and more
accountable communities.
