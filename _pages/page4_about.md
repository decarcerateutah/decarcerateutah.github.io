Decarcerate Utah is a prison abolitionist group focused on education and outreach.
We facilitate space to teach and learn about what abolition means in the 21st century.
We believe in alternatives to policing, prisons, and border control that reduce harm
and create safe communities.  We prioritize the human lives and voices who are affected
most by mass incarceration in the US over corporate interests.  We seek to find new
ways of working toward safety that are not commonly practiced today.

Join us as we grow to transform so-called Utah and our neighboring communities.
