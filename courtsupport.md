# Sign up to be a Court Support Volunteer
Hello! Decarcerate Utah is organizing a group of volunteers to support of our community members facing charges. If you are interested in volunteering, please fill out the form at the bottom of this page and we'll reach out to you with more information about hearings and how to best support each defendant. 

Since court procedures can be fairly strict, there are some things we need to keep in mind:

1. While courts do not usually have an official dress code, you may be denied entry or asked to leave for wearing "inappropriate" attire such as flip flops; hats; shorts; shirts like tank tops, tube tops, or halters that reveal your shoulders; low-riding pants that fall below your hips; ripped or torn clothing; clothing that exposes your underwear, midriff, or chest; or clothing that mention or promote illegal activity, violence, profanity, or sexual activity. You should dress comfortably but respectfullyâ€”you don't have to wear a suit, but many courtrooms recommend collared shirts or blouses and long pants/skirts, or dresses. 
2. In order to be respectful of the defendants we are supporting and to help them achieve the best possible outcome, it's important to remember that there is NO DIRECT ACTION to be taking place at these events. You should also avoid eating in the courtroom, talking during courtroom proceedings, using your cell phone, or otherwise distracting the court.
3. The timing of court proceedings can be strange and, at times, frustrating. Many defendants are scheduled for the same time slot, so you may wait minutes for your defendant to be called to face the judge, or you may wait over an hour. We have experienced court proceedings that take twenty minutes from entering the courthouse to leaving it, and others that take much longer. Make sure your schedule is flexible (and bring a book or something to do!) when you RSVP to court support events as you may have to wait patiently.
4. Because of the nature of these court proceedings, sometimes there may be very little notice given before these events. If you can't make an event due to the late notice, that's ok! Please try to RSVP as soon as possible so that we know how many to expect in attendance.
5. Due to COVID-19, some (but not all) court proceedings are virtual, using programs like Webex or Zoom. We do not know how long virtual court dates will be offered. Please specify if you are willing or able to attend in-person events as well as virtual ones so that we can invite you accordingly.

We are using an Individual Support Model (page 4 of [this resource](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e1f966c45f53f254011b45a/t/5e35aa598d7df649e77e9fc0/1580575321975/CJE_Courtwatching_FINAL.pdf)), so please review the information and let us know if you have any questions.

Thank you for your support, and please feel free to share with anyone else who might be interested in volunteering! 

In Solidarity, 
Decarcerate Utah
