On December 12th, we held a workshop about the History of Policing.
You can find the
[history of policing notes](http://criticalresistance.org/policing-timeline/)
here.

Thank you to those who came and learned about this important topic.
Understanding the history of how policing power rose in the US is
crucial in looking forward to abolishing the police altogether.
