I am an abolitionist because I want safety for every member of our community.

I am an abolitionist because I know that systems based in fear and control
can never create peace and justice.

I am an abolitionist because I want every victim to reach a full level of
autonomy and closure.

I am an abolitionist because I know that punishing those who cause harm will
never heal victims.

I am an abolitionist because I want a society that supports education,
wellness, and connection.

I am an abolitionist because I know that putting more money in policing and
prisons will only create more chaos and despair.

I am an abolitionist because I want the most marginalized to be centered in
all of our fights for social justice.

I am an abolitionist because I know the prison industrial complex was created
to dominate the most marginalized and enforce the power of the status quo.

I am an abolitionist because I want all power to the people.

I am an abolitionist because I know that most crime was/is invented and policed
to enforce class control.

I am an abolitionist because I want holistic methodology to heal social violence.

I am an abolitionist because I know the effects of trauma cause more destructive
behaviors.

I am an abolitionist because I want creativity and imagination to be an integral
part of forming a new social order.

I am an abolitionist because I know abolition is possible: right here, right now.
