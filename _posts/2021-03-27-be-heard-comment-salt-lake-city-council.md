# Be Heard!
The SLC Council determines the city budget. Share your voice on how taxpayer dollars are spent in your community by attending city council meetings, or by submitting your comment beforehand. 

Often in the city council work meetings, they discuss proposed budget amendments, many of which include expansions to the police department. Since last summer, the council has submitted seven budget amendments increasing funding for the SLCPD. This is to increase police presence at protests, perform camp abatements, and provide more police equipment. 

As a community, we can apply pressure to stop the expansion of policing!  

# Here’s how to speak up: 
<b>WHEN:</b> Work sessions are most Tuesdays at 2 p.m., and formal meetings are most Tuesdays at 7 p.m. Work sessions are usually listen-only, where formal meetings have a public comment period. 
You can find the [meeting schedule on the city’s website](http://www.slc.gov/council/virtual-meetings/). You can also register to submit public comments, find your district representative, subscribe to meeting updates, and more at that link.
 
<b>WHERE:</b> Virtual meetings can be viewed via WebEx, Facebook, YouTube, and SLCTV Channel 17.
