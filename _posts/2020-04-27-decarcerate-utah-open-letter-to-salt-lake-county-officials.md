To Whom It May Concern:

Incarceration is harmful to the health of everyone in jails, prisons, and
detention centers, and not only during times of global health crisis. This
threat affects people who are currently incarcerated, people who were formerly
incarcerated, their loved ones, and the people who work in these facilities. The
COVID-19 pandemic adds a concentrated urgency to this reality and foregrounds
important truths about how incarceration exacerbates long-standing social
disparities.

Prior to the pandemic, Utah already had one of the highest rates of jail deaths
per capita in the nation. In 2017, UT saw more jail deaths than any other state.
Incarcerated people in Utah stand at particular risk of dying from COVID-19.

Growing public health research on the harms of incarceration has repeatedly
affirmed what frontline communities have said all along:

- [Incarceration measurably harms one’s mental and physical health.
](https://www.rwjf.org/en/library/research/2019/01/mass-incarceration-threatens-health-equity-in-america.html)

- [Incarceration negatively impacts one’s family and community health.
](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7249/mg1165tce.13?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents)

- [The criminal legal system disproportionately harms people who are structurally marginalized
](https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2019/01/29/law-enforcement-violence),
including Black people, Latinx people, indigenous people, immigrants, people
with disabilities, queer and transgender people, and people with low incomes.

This pandemic reminds us that we are all only as safe and healthy as the most
vulnerable among us.

This pandemic reminds us that overcrowded spaces—such as jails, prisons, and
detention centers—are, at best, precarious environments for our health.

This pandemic reminds us that we have failed to create a functional social
safety net—including healthcare, housing, and paid leave—in this county and
beyond.

These grim realities demand immediate action in order to keep us all safe from
COVID-19 and to build the healthy communities we seek beyond this pandemic. We
believe our actions must center people who face incarceration, as they are among
the most vulnerable in our society.

Thus, we continue to urge Salt Lake County officials to meet the following demands:

1. **Salt Lake County must stop incarcerating people**. No new people should enter
Metro or Oxbow Jail. This includes but is not limited to:

    1. Ending Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention/custody,
    implementing zero transfers to ICE, and ending any collusion with ICE to
    arrest community members.

    2. Ending the criminalization of unhoused people, including police sweeps of
    unsheltered people and people living in vacant units.

    3. Ending crimeless revocations.

    4. Ending money bail and pretrial incarceration in favor of the presumption of
    release.

    5. Supporting decriminalization efforts, including drug use and sex work.

2. **Salt Lake County must decarcerate its jails**. It is unsafe to be inside
jails right now. The consequence of county inaction will be death. We expect
releases to happen in waves; thus, steps to decarceration include but are not
limited to:

    1. Prioritizing immediate release of those who are most directly vulnerable to
    COVID-19, including adults over the age of 50 (as called for by the Salt
    Lake County Public Defender), pregnant people, immunosuppressed people, and
    people with disabilities or chronic illnesses.

    2. Releasing those who are primary caregivers for anyone who falls in the
    above categories.

    3. Releasing those who are incarcerated pretrial.

    4. Releasing those who are incarcerated on low-level offenses, including
    charges or convictions due to mental health or substance abuse needs.

    5. Releasing those with a scheduled 2020 or 2021 calendar year release date.

    6. Releasing all persons incarcerated in Metro and Oxbow jails by April 30,
    2020.

3. **Salt Lake County must meet the immediate needs of people who are
incarcerated**. There is no way to be inside a jail safely. In Salt Lake
County’s Public Health Order (2020-4) issued by Salt Lake County Mayor Jennifer
Wilson and Executive Director of the Salt Lake County Health Department Gary
Edwards, they state that urgent action is required to slow the transmission of
COVID-19. They asserted that if social distance measures are not taken, the
pandemic will overwhelm our healthcare systems in April and May 2020.
<br /><br />
Social distancing is impossible for people inside of a jail. While we actively
decarcerate, we must ensure that those who are still inside get their health
needs met and are able to stay fully connected to their social support network.
At a minimum, action steps include:

    1. Ensuring proper access to hygiene materials, including soap, sanitizing
    wipes, and high-alcohol hand sanitizer.

    2. Ensuring thorough and regular cleaning of the premises.

    3. Eliminating fees for phone calls and visitation by video.

    4. Ensuring that state law requiring no jail copays for medical or dental
    visits is being fully implemented.

    5. Barring the use of lockdowns, administrative segregation, or solitary
    confinement.

    6. Ensuring proper access to healthcare, including COVID-19 testing and mental
    health services.

    7. Ensuring access to nutritious food and drinks.

    8. Protecting people’s ability to sleep and rest to the full extent necessary.

4. **Salt Lake County must invest in the assets that make our communities
   healthy**. As we divest from jails, prisons, detention centers, and policing,
we must invest in health-affirming resources, such as robust health care,
affordable housing, living wages, quality schools, environmental justice
measures, and adequate transportation. Examples of the types of policies that
our community seeks include:

    1. Ending evictions ordered by the court or carried out by the sheriff’s
    office.

    2. Improving fair-chance hiring and retention policies to ensure formerly
    incarcerated people can access quality career, job, and apprenticeship
    opportunities without the threat of discrimination.

    3. Instituting a moratorium on housing exclusions against people with criminal
    records.

This moment calls for bold strides to ensure families are able to protect
themselves from both COVID-19 and state violence. It is the time for action.

We expect you to release a comprehensive county plan of action by Monday, May 4,
2020 at 9:00 a.m. MST with a public report on progress by Friday, May 8, 2020
and every subsequent Monday until the COVID-19 state of emergency is lifted
federally, statewide, and in our county.

Sincerely,

Decarcerate Utah
